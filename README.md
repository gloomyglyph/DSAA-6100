This repository contains a Kaggle notebook focused on fine-tuning a large language model using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) techniques. This approach is particularly useful for efficiently fine-tuning large transformer models while reducing computational requirements and memory usage.

## Overview

This notebook utilizes Hugging Face's Transformers library and other essential NLP libraries to:
1. Load a pre-trained MT5 model and tokenizer.
2. Fine-tune the model with LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation).
3. Perform data preprocessing and model training on the Kaggle platform.

## Key Steps

### 1. Model Loading
The notebook begins by loading an MT5 model, a powerful encoder-decoder model for multilingual tasks. It also initializes the tokenizer necessary for input processing.

### 2. Data Preprocessing
The notebook covers data loading and preprocessing, converting raw input into a format suitable for fine-tuning the model. It leverages the `datasets` library for efficient handling of large datasets.

### 3. Fine-Tuning with LoRA
LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) is implemented using the `peft` library. The technique helps reduce the number of trainable parameters by decomposing the adaptation matrices, making it feasible to fine-tune large models even with limited resources.

### 4. Training and Evaluation
Utilizing Hugging Face's Trainer API, the notebook performs training with custom training arguments to optimize model performance on the given dataset. It also provides methods to evaluate and validate the modelâ€™s outputs.

## Requirements

This notebook is designed for use on Kaggle, which includes most of the required libraries. Additional installations, if required, are handled within the notebook.

### Key Libraries
- `transformers`
- `datasets`
- `torch`
- `peft` (for Low-Rank Adaptation)

## Usage

To use this notebook:
1. Clone or download the notebook.
2. Upload to a Kaggle kernel, or run locally with appropriate setup.
3. Run each cell sequentially to train and evaluate the model.

## Results

After training, the notebook includes sections for evaluating model accuracy and quality, along with potential next steps for deploying or further tuning the model.
